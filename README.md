# CatLink485 Shield

Arduino-compatible shield featuring LTE Cat M1, GPS, and RS-485 connectivity, powered by the nRF9151 chipset.

## Overview

This repository focuses on the **Arduino libraries and firmware** for the CatLink485 shield.

Hardware design files (schematics, PCB layouts, etc.) are **not publicly available**.

## Features

- LTE Cat M1 communication (based on nRF9151)
- GPS location tracking
- Industrial RS-485 interface
- Network protocols support:
  - UDP
  - DDNS Resolver (Dynamic DNS resolution)
  - Ping (ICMP)
  - TCP
  - MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)

## Arduino Library

The Arduino-compatible library simplifies communication with the CatLink485 shield, including LTE, GPS, RS-485, and network functions.

## Examples

Sample Arduino sketches demonstrating how to use the shield's features are available in the `examples` directory.

## Getting Started

1. Connect the CatLink485 shield to your Arduino board.
2. Install the Arduino library from this repository.
3. Upload example sketches and configure settings as needed.
